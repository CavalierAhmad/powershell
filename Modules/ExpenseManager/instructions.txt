THIS TABLE IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR VIEWING, SO FORMATTING WILL BE NEEDED.

BUT FIRST, IT NEEDS TO BE PROCESSED (ADDING AND REMOVAL OF COLUMNS, APPLICATION OF LOGIC)

UPON IMPORTING, STORE THE RAW TABLE IN THE MAIN SCOPE (DOMAIN) FOR UPDATING, TO DO LATER

FOR NOW, FOCUS IS TO REFINE THE RAW TABLE TO MAKE IT PRESENTABLE AND EFFICIENT AT CONVEYING INFORMATION,

HERE IS THE END GOAL, IT WILL BE CALLED "viewTable":

ID  Name of Bill Monthly Biweekly Daily Time Left                 Status Deadline Source
--  ------------ ------- -------- ----- ---------                 ------ -------- ------
X00 Car Payment  999$    99$      9$    COLOR GRADIENT 99[/TOTAL] auto   MMM d    cheque or credit

There will also be a legend:

italics means inaccurate amount, needs update

And an option line:

[Highlighted] `mod` for updating value ...


TODO 1: Process table

ID = rawTable.id
args: id

Name of Bill = rawTable.name
args: name

Monthly = (stylish string) <- rates[0] <- (amount, frequency)
Biweekly = (stylish string) <- rates[1] <- (amount, frequency)
Daily = (stylish string) <- rates[2] <- (amount, frequency)
args: amount, frequency, isVariable

Time Left = diff = (nextPayment - now)[.days | .hours | .minutes]
	Then pass diff = [time,unit] to styling function emphasize (diff
	If bill has final date:
		finalDiff = (finalPayment - now).days
	Then append to diff: /finalDiff
args: nextPayment finalPayment

Status = {AUTO,UNPPAID,PAID,UNSECURED,secured}
	This one needs a legend AUTO, XP, P, XSEC, SEC, 
	Add color then send to table
args: status

Source = rawTable.source

Deadline = raw date string -> date object -> toString MMM-d
arg: nextpayment

Final Deadline = raw date string -> date object -> toString MMM-d
arg: finalPayment

-----

After first processing is done, on to second processing: aggreagtion

add empty apdding row then add sums and averages based on few criteria:
	do not mix cheque and credit types together
